          <p>Hi, I'm Max Warren. I have lived in Springville my whole life and am a fourth generation Springville Red
            Devil, so obviously my school pride runs deep. I love attending our sporting events, reading, biking,
            dogs, and long walks on the beach. All of my siblings outshine me in sports so vote for me for student
            council so my mom will be proud of me too.</p>

          <p>Hi there, hello name is Gibson Condie, I love sports, athletics, and eating cereal at 12:00 am.
            You might know me, and you might not and that’s okay, because I might know you and I might not, so it works
            out. If you need help with physics, I’m probably not the right person to go to but if you need help on
            anything else, I can definitely give it my best shot and try to help. I’m pretty good at that.</p>

            in running is to help more people feel included, welcomed and appreciated at Springville High. I know it’s

            difference…and I think I am the type of person that can do that. I love getting to know people, serving
            others, and having fun!</p>
